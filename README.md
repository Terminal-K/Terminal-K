Hi,

I'm a first-year graduate student from [School of CSEE](http://csee.hnu.edu.cn/), [Hunan University (HNU)](https://www.hnu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes 3D vision and deep learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhiyong Li](http://robotics.hnu.edu.cn/info/1071/1515.htm) and [Prof. Kailun Yang](https://yangkailun.com/) of [**Computer Vision for Panoramic Understanding Lab (CV:PU)**](https://yangkailun.com/team.html). Before that, I received the B.S. degree at [South China Normal University (SCNU)](https://www.scnu.edu.cn/).
